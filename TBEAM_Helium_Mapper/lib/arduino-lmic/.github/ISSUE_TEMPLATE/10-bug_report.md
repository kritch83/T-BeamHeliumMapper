**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. _If you're not sure it's a bug, please consider opening a discussion at [forum.mcci.io](https://forum.mcci.io/c/device-software/arduino-lmic/5), or file a Support Request instead._ A bug is a problem in the code, where you do something that the documentation says should work, but doesn't; _and_ you have reason to believe it's not working due to a defect in the code.

Wireless is tricky; if in doubt, start with a support request, rather than a bug report.

- Version of Arduino IDE being used.

- Board (MCCI Catena, Adafruit Feather M0, Heltec, etc.)
